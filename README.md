# DataWrangling
Looking at twitter archives to investigate the weratesdogs twitter account 
The twitter account is used by people who like to share pictures of thiers dogs, these rating are always above 10 and are accompanied by a picture. The data for the project was provided but there was the need for extra data to fill in the gaps and to give more to work with. These extra bits of data were a image predictions for the dogs pictures in each post, the rest of the data was additional tweet information gained forom twitter using thier API. 


The data was then assesed to see if there was tidyness issues and inconsistencies, the issues were then cleaned and sorted all this was part of the data wrnagling process. After these steps were carried out, analysis was carried out nad many interesting insights were observed.
